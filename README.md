# bash-check-script
Basic system checks with formatting

This script must be run on CentOS/RHEL 7 or Fedora. Several checks and the formatting depend on systemd and running systemctl commands. 

Can be modified to check for anything. Currently, it checks for resolv.conf settings, running services (via an array), disk space, and ping tests.
